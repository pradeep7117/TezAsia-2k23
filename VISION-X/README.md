TezAsia 23 Hackathon Submission form Details

Team Name: VISION-X

Project name: TezMint

Project's Description: 
TezMint is a revolutionary project aimed at bridging the gap between artists, content creators, and technology by providing a seamless, reliable, and user-friendly platform that leverages Web3.0 and blockchain technology. The project's primary focus is a decentralized marketplace that empowers local talented artists, content creators, NFT producers, and distributors. Through TezMint, users can showcase their creativity, monetize their talents, and engage with a thriving community of like-minded individuals.

What problem you are trying to solve: 
- Lack of Platform for Local Artists: Many talented local artists struggle to find a reliable and accessible platform to showcase their creativity and monetize their work, limiting their exposure and potential earnings.

- High Gas Fees: The prevalent issue of high gas fees on blockchain networks hampers the growth and adoption of decentralized applications, making transactions expensive and discouraging user engagement.

- Complex Transition to Web3.0: Government entities, commercial bodies, and private systems often face challenges when transitioning to Web3.0 and blockchain technology, including the need for clear guidance and effective integration.

- Inefficiencies in Commission Models: Existing commission models in certain platforms may disproportionately benefit intermediaries, leaving creators with a smaller share of their earnings.

- Limited User-Friendly Interfaces: Many blockchain-based platforms lack user-friendly interfaces, preventing easy adoption and use by a broader audience, including non-technical users.

TezMint aims to solve these problems by providing a user-friendly, secure, and decentralized marketplace that empowers artists, content creators, and users. It reduces barriers for local artists to showcase their talent, minimizes transaction costs with its gas-free approach, facilitates the adoption of Web3.0 for government and private entities, offers a fair commission structure, and ensures an intuitive platform for seamless interaction.
